Help - capture and report emergencies with a snap.

Problem statement:
When an accident occurs in the streets of India, people dial 108 and 100 to call and ambulance and inform the police.
The crowd then narrates the events that took place and accordingly further action is taken. However, owing to the high
population and density of India, several problems are faced while carrying out these actions. Firstly, accurate location
of the accident might not be communicated properly to the officials and that would result in delay in carrying out of
the standard protocols. Since in most of such events time is of the essence, proper communication and protocols, if not
taken quickly can lead to the loss of lives. 'Help' is an app which focusses on this problem and tries to solve it.

Our solution:
'Help' is an app which is used to communicate about accidents as soon as possible to the designated authorities, so that
urgent care can be taken to avoid loss of lives. When an accident is seen, any citizen present in the scene of the accident
can whip out their mobile devices and capture the scene with Help and fill in important details of the accident. The 
coordinates of the user, along with the data entered and snap taken, is sent to the nearest police authorities. This ensures
no time is lost and accurate, legitimate information is passed on to competent authorities for further actions to be taken
by them.
We have an admin dashboard for the police authorities to view the reported accidents happening in their area. This makes the
entire process hassle free and reduces errors in judgement.
